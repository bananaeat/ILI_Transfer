# ILI_Transfer
The repository to hold experiment code for my Master degree's project in.

Most of code that I use for experiments are holded in files 'baseline_experiment.ipynb' and 'baseline_experiment_rnn.ipynb'. 'query_selection.ipynb' was used to filter queries. 'plot_results.ipynb' was used to plot some figures (unused in the report) for transfer learning.

To make use of these code, you will have to train the 10 models first (using seed 50-59). Then, you can run transfer learning evaluation code to evaluate performance.
